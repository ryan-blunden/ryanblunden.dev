# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds all site code: Astro components in `src/components/`, Tailwind styles in `src/styles/`, and media in `src/assets/`.
- `src/content/` contains Starlight content collections; docs live in `src/content/docs/` and collection config in `src/content/config.ts`.
- `public/` is for static files copied verbatim to the site root.
- `dist/` is the build output generated by Astro.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` installs dependencies.
- `npm run dev` starts the Astro dev server at `localhost:4321`.
- `npm run build` runs `astro check` then builds the site into `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the production build locally.
- `npm run astro -- <command>` runs Astro CLI tasks (e.g., `astro add`, `astro check`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Indentation uses tabs, matching existing `.astro` and `.ts` files.
- Use single quotes in TypeScript and Astro frontmatter.
- Component filenames are kebab-case (e.g., `youtube-card.astro`).
- Content docs follow Starlight’s structure and are stored under `src/content/docs/`.
- Formatting is handled with Prettier (`prettier` in `devDependencies`); run it if you introduce formatting drift.

## Testing Guidelines
- There are no unit-test suites in this repo.
- Use `npm run build` (includes `astro check`) as the primary verification step for type/content correctness.
- For UI changes, validate locally with `npm run dev` or `npm run preview`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent commits use short, sentence-style summaries (e.g., “Update title and add new YouTube videos”). Keep commits to a single line and in the imperative or present tense.
- PRs should include: a concise description, linked issue or context, and screenshots for visual/UI updates.
- Note any content or configuration changes that affect deployment (e.g., new assets or Starlight config updates).
