			<h2 class="section-title">FAQs</h2>
			<FAQList title="FAQs">
				<FAQ title="How do you charge for your services?">
					<p>
						I usually charge a set rate for projects and larger jobs with predefined
						scope or an hourly rate for small one-off tasks.
					</p>
					<p>
						In any case, you'll always receive a cost estimate up-front and I will
						provide you with a detailed invoice for each project.
					</p>
				</FAQ>
				<FAQ title="How long does it take to complete a project?">
					<p>
						The time frame for completion depends upon the scope and complexity of
						work and how many other jobs are in the pipeline.
					</p>
					<p>
						The more we work together and the greater understanding I have of your
						product and services, the faster I can turn around work.
					</p>
					<p>
						I produce content quickly and have a collaborative and iterative process
						to ensure the content is always heading in the right direction.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'll send you updates frequently so you're always aware of my progress and
						will let you know ahead of time if there are unforeseen delays or issues.
					</p>
				</FAQ>
				<FAQ title="How do you communicate with your clients?">
					<p>
						I communicate using whatever method and platform (e.g. Slack Connect)
						works best for them.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am flexible and responsive, and will reply to your messages and emails
						as soon as possible.
					</p>
				</FAQ>
				<FAQ title="How do you handle revisions and feedback?">
					<p>
						I don't tend to have set rules around the number of revisions and feedback
						as I find good planning, communication of scope, and preparation ahead of
						time negate the need for a large number of revisions.
					</p>
					<p>
						My collaborative approach means we get to a final version relatively
						quickly because I ensure we remain aligned on the content goals and vision
						as the project progresses.
					</p>
					<p>
						I want you to be really happy (not just satisfied), with the end result
						will gladly accommodate your requests until the content is where it needs
						to be.
					</p>
				</FAQ>
				<FAQ title="How do you deliver your content?">
					<p>
						I deliver my content in whatever format best suits you. I tend to produce
						the drafts in Google docs as it has superb tooling for collaborative
						editing but can publish the content in your CMS or editorial tool of
						choice.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the conclusion of each project, I'll provide you with the source files,
						images, videos, or any other assets that I used to create the content.
					</p>
				</FAQ>
				<FAQ title="Does the content need to be attributed to you?">
					<p>That's completely your choice!</p>
					<p>
						You can attach my name to blog posts or I can be used as a ghostwriter.
					</p>
				</FAQ>
				<FAQ title="What are the benefits of working with you?">
					<p>
						I'm friendly and easy going, and will feel like a new member of your team.
					</p>
					<p>
						I genuinely care about the impact my work has on your team and business,
						and I will always go the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied and
						happy with the content.
