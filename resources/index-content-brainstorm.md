# Content Strategy & Messaging (Source of Truth)

“I turn existing technical materials—docs, demos, blog posts, and presentations—into accurate video used for developer enablement, product onboarding, and customer success.  
This is not promotional video. It is technical content, produced so your team doesn’t have to be on camera.”

**Approved hero positioning:**  
Accelerate technical video content delivery without putting your engineers on camera.  
I convert existing technical content into self-contained videos that drive developer engagement across your documentation, marketing site, and YouTube.

## Above-the-fold Video (DevRel Positioning)

- Video is 30–60 seconds, direct-to-camera
- Tone: calm, technical, no hype, no music
- Purpose: allow prospects to quickly decide if I can represent their product unsupervised
- Positioning angle: former DevRel explaining a familiar problem plainly

### Video should communicate:

- This is not promotional or brand video
- This work is for developer enablement, onboarding, and customer success
- Engineers do not need to be on camera
- Marketing can sponsor this without owning technical accuracy
- I work from existing technical materials, not discovery or ideation

### Video should implicitly demonstrate:

- Technical credibility
- Clear, structured communication
- Comfort explaining real systems
- A style developers would respect

### Post-video value statement (why this matters)

Leverage the technical assets you already have into videos that accelerate developer onboarding, enablement, and activation.

This line exists to translate the offer into outcomes for marketing, product, and customer success stakeholders after the video establishes credibility.

## The Opportunity: Accelerating Technical Video Enablement

## V2 (new opportunity layout)

### New

Most teams already understand the benefits video can bring to marketing, sales, onboarding, and customer support.

The challenge is not belief — it’s execution.

Video production introduces an entirely new set of skills and constraints: scripting, recording, lighting, audio, editing, and review cycles. Without a dedicated production function or a video-savvy DevRel, it’s a heavy lift. Asking engineers to step in as presenters only compounds the problem.

When video depends on engineers being available, comfortable on camera, and pulled into production cycles, it becomes slow, inconsistent, and politically expensive. As a result, video rarely compounds the way documentation does.

That’s video on hard mode.

**There is an easier model.**

Most teams already have the hardest part done. The technical knowledge required for developers to successfully use your product already exists — scattered across documentation, demos, internal guides, and blog posts.

The opportunity is to convert the technical assets you already have into video that can be reused across onboarding, enablement, and customer success — without creating new bottlenecks or dependencies on individual contributors.

This shifts video from a one-off effort into a predictable, scalable delivery model that compounds alongside your documentation.

### Original

- Technical video is one of the highest-leverage assets for developer enablement, onboarding, and customer success.
- Many teams already have the raw material required to produce it: documentation, demos, blog posts, and internal guides.
- The limiting factor is not buy-in or belief — it is speed, focus, and a repeatable way to execute.

- Engineers no longer need to be the bottleneck in delivering technical video.
- YOU don't need to invest in buying and learning how to use cameras, lights and audio equipment
- Marketing can confidently sponsor enablement content without owning technical accuracy.
- Product and customer success teams can ship video alongside features, not months later.
- Youget influencer-quality video but with the ability to guide messaging through c collabporative scripting process

This creates a clear opportunity: teams that can reliably convert existing technical knowledge into video gain faster activation, clearer communication, and compounding value from work they have already done.

## Why Video Matters Now (Context for Decision-Makers)

This section exists for secondary stakeholders (e.g. CMOs, Heads of Marketing, CS leadership) who may be assessing whether prioritising technical video is worth doing at all.

It should be concise, credible, and evidence-based — not a full research narrative.

### Core signals to highlight:

- **Technical content with video drives significantly deeper engagement**  
  Pages that include video consistently see materially higher time-on-page and stronger engagement than text-only resources. For documentation and blog content, video increases the likelihood that complex material is actually consumed rather than skimmed.

- **B2B buyers prefer video when evaluating complex products**  
  A strong majority of B2B buyers report preferring video over text when learning about products, and report higher confidence in vendors after watching technical video.

### Why this matters specifically now (2025 → 2026):

- AI-generated search summaries are reducing click-through to text-only content.
- Video increases dwell time and perceived value of existing pages, helping them stand out.
- Video assets can be reused across enablement, onboarding, sales, and customer success.

The intent is to establish urgency without overwhelming the reader. Detailed justification can live in future blog posts or downloadable research, not on the core site.

## Why existing alternatives fail (and why I won’t)

**Substitute 1: Internal team does it**

- Slow
- Politically expensive
- Non-repeatable
- Dependent on individuals

**Substitute 2: Generic video agencies**

- Don’t understand the product
- Require heavy hand-holding
- High coordination overhead
- One-off assets, not systems

**Substitute 3: Fiverr / voiceover / AI video**

- Technically inaccurate
- Sounds generic
- Destroys credibility with technical buyers
- Requires _more_ review time, not less

**Your structural advantage**

You are not “a video person who learned tech.”  
You are **a technologist who productized video output**.

That gives you:

- Faster comprehension
- Fewer review cycles
- Higher trust with engineers
- Lower cognitive load for the client

## Messaging ideas

- “If it’s already documented, I can turn it into accurate video with minimal, time-boxed input from your team.”
- “One setup call. One review pass. Everything else is async.”

## The process (inputs and outputs)

To produce video, you provide:

- Written documentation, README, or internal docs
- Existing screenshots or slides (if available)
- Access to a demo environment _or_ a reproducible setup
- One technical point of contact for clarification
- e do a short setup call to align on scope and environment access, then everything moves async.

  • “Turn documentation into walk-throughs”  
  • “Turn guides into demos”  
  • “Turn written knowledge into reusable video”

“If your product is already documented, I can turn that into accurate, production-ready video with minimal involvement from your team.”

## Why me and why someone technical

My technical background matters  
• You can reconstruct environments  
• You understand CI/CD, infra, APIs  
• You can infer behavior from docs  
• You don’t need step-by-step babysitting

Developers are extremely sensitive to marketing BS and part of the challenge of establishing credibility comes heavily from whether the content representative developers is credible, so therefore whoever the video presenter is must be credible in their eyes also.

### My experience

- Been a DevRel at two previous companies
- Been a technical trainer and presenter for years before that
- Have continued to build full-stack applications for freelance clients
- AI is heavily integrated into my day-to-day business and of course, agentic development process

That’s the wedge between you and:  
• Video agencies  
• Generic presenters  
• AI video and text to speech tools

### On being Australian

Intervention straight up that having an Aussie on camera won't work for every company, but why it does work, is Australians no one for being no BS we're not flamboyant we're not overexcited and we stick to the facts and explain things plainly and I think that really that resonates with developers across all cultures. Something along these lines anyway..

## Testimonials (Credibility Signals)

Purpose of testimonials:

- Reinforce technical credibility and trust
- Validate that the process is low-friction and async-friendly
- Reassure marketing buyers that technical stakeholders were satisfied

Guidelines for testimonial selection:

- Prioritize quotes from DevRel, engineering, product, or platform leaders
- Marketing testimonials should reference technical confidence, not creativity
- Avoid generic praise (e.g. “great to work with”)

Ideal themes to highlight:

- “Didn’t need much of our time”
- “Technically accurate without hand-holding”
- “Engineers trusted the content”
- “Shipped faster than expected”

Placement guidance:

- Testimonials should appear after Proof of Work
- Keep quotes short (1–2 sentences)
- Prefer named roles and companies where possible

## FAQs

(here's a starting point)

- do you use a script and do we have control over messaging?
  I always use a script so the structure of the video is clear and we can collaborate on messaging and stick reasonably close to that script during delivery, which helps make it more natural and conversational, but I'll always preserve your specific product messaging.

## Intake & Qualification Flow (JotForm → Cal.com)

The goal of the intake form is not lead capture, but context capture. It exists to ensure that calls are productive, specific, and mutually useful.

This form is intentionally short (under 2 minutes to complete) and primarily uses multiple-choice and multi-select questions.

### Why this step exists:

- To understand where a team is in their video journey
- To identify bottlenecks and motivations
- To confirm that the standard, productized video process is a good fit
- To avoid spending the first 15–20 minutes of a call on background

### High-level flow:

1. Visitor clicks the primary CTA
2. Visitor completes a short JotForm context form
3. Upon completion, visitor is directed to book a setup call via Cal.com
4. Form responses are sent to both parties before the call

### Core information captured (v1):

- Current stage in video adoption
- Primary reason for exploring video now
- Existing technical materials available
- Types of video being considered
- Current bottlenecks or constraints
- Optional links to documentation or content under consideration
- Optional free-text context

### Design constraints:

- No file uploads
- Optional URLs only (no required links)
- Minimal free-text fields
- Clear, respectful language (not an “application”)

### Automation note:

JotForm provides both an API and MCP server support. This allows the intake form to be programmatically created, modified, and extended over time (e.g. conditional logic, routing to consulting vs. standard process, CRM integration) without changing the core site flow.

The initial implementation should remain simple. Automation and branching logic can be layered on later once traffic and patterns are understood.
